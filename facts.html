Nepals government is coming under increasing pressure to release C K Raut, an activist who has been imprisoned after being accused of fomenting a secessionist campaign.

Mr Raut, who was arrested in mid-September, has been charged with sedition for demanding that the region of Madhesh, in the southern plains of Nepal, be declared an independent state.

His arrest has drawn fierce criticism, within Nepal as well as outside. Prachanda, the leading opposition politician, said after Mr Rauts arrest that every political opinion had a right to be heard. “Those demanding a reinstatement of the monarchy are free to speak up, and those advocating the right to self-determination also should not be arrested,” he said.
